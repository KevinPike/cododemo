Nats
====

NATS is an open-source, lightweight cloud messaging system.

NATS was created by Derek Collison, Founder/CEO of Apcera who has spent 20+ years designing, building, and using publish-subscribe messaging systems. Unlike traditional enterprise messaging systems, NATS has an always-on dial tone that does whatever it takes to remain available. This forms a great base for building modern, reliable, and scalable cloud and distributed systems.
